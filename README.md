# Blackberry Mobile Game Development - SpaceFighter

#### Intro
Many, many years ago when BlackBerrys were cool and reading email on a phone was even cooler, 
people were developing mobile Java apps for their blackberry devices, and this was mine.
It is a simple mobile version of my favorite 90's arcade game, Galaga. It allowed me to use
some of the Trig I learned from highschool and get started in developing mobile Java apps.

To use and deploy this game you will need a Java JDK 1.4 and the BlackBerry Java Plug-in for Eclipse.
You can import this project into the Eclipse Blackberry environment and build it and run it on a
desktop simulator. 
To build and deploy the application to a Blackberry device please refer to the Blackberry-How-To-Sign-and-Deploy
document in this folder.
